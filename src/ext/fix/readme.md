Contains fixes for existing API or polyfills for often used APIs. Sometimes related to ES5 but outside of this package because of size effects e.g. Function.bind() is not supported by a wide range of otherwise ES5 supporting browsers. Also fixes bugs like parsing ISO dates or new upcoming APIs like requestAnimationFrame. It is hard to feature detect and load these dynamically as the field of support is so widespread and different that it would result in endless number of builds.
