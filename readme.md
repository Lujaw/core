Core - A Fine Foundation for JavaScript Projects
================================================

Core prepares the ground for JavaScript projects. It fills what is missing, fixes what is wrong, adds what is useful. While doing this it is still a pretty lightweight framework which is a good start for all kind of JavaScript projects.

Core was designed to work together with the JavaScript tooling project [Jasy](https://github.com/zynga/jasy).

## Components

### Basic Fixes

Fixes for issues or missing features in specific JavaScript implementations (core.fix.*)

* `Array.prototype.indexOf`
* `console`
* `Date.now`
* `document.head`
* `execScript`
* `Function.prototype.bind`
* HTML5 markup support for IE
* `Object.keys`
* `setTimeout`/`setIntervals` with additional arguments

### ES5 Support

* *Array*: `isArray`
* *Array.prototype*: `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `every`, `some`, `reduce`, `reduceRight`, `lastIndexOf`
* *Date.prototype*: `toISOString`, `toJSON`
* *JSON*: `stringify`, `parse`
* *String.prototype*: `trim`

### Language Extensions

* Synthetic sugar for better comfort during JavaScript development


### Polyfills

* Base64 Support
* Local Storage (TODO)
* Request Animation Frame
* Immediate Function Calls


### Object Orientation

* Supports classes, mixins and interfaces with convenient "closed" syntax
* Prefers composition of classes/mixins instead of deep inheritance hierarchies
* Supports interfaces for validating support. Prefers them instead of abstract classes.


### Property Support

* Basic setter/getter creation for classes based on config (core.property.*)
* Super efficient data storage
* Validation of incoming values
* Custom apply logic when changes occur
* Event system integration (TODO)
* Groups of properties e.g. paddingLeft, paddingTop, ... => padding
* Multi properties with support for multi value storage (themed, user, inherited)


### Tooling

Most of these features are especially useful to use in conjunction with [Jasy](https://github.com/wpbasti/jasy)

* Basic feature detection for browser engine, ES5 support, locale, URL parameters, etc. (core.detect.*)
* Asset loading and URL resolution in complex multi project structures (core.Asset)
* Support for storing image sizes and image sprite data in a central location.


### Professionalism

* Extendable type test and assertion module (core.Test)
* Useful to harden methods to enforce specific incoming values


### IO

* Asynchronous load system for JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, text, json, etc.
* Detection of network availability (core.io.Network)


### Browser Object Model

* Managing CSS class names (core.bom.ClassName)
* Serializing HTML forms (core.bom.Form)


### Utilities

* Adler32 checksum algorithm
* CRC32 checksum algorithm
